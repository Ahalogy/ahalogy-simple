    <p>This recipe comes from the cookbook, <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/twpeanthpo-20/detail/1617690481" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bountiful</a>, written and photographed by our dear friends Todd Porter and Diane Cu (<a href="http://whiteonricecouple.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">White on Rice Couple</a>). The cookbook is more than just a book. It is a work of art and a labor of love. The book is filled with 100 recipes inspired from Todd and Diane&#8217;s amazing garden. The recipes are fresh, seasonal and simple. We&#8217;ve already bookmarked just about every recipe&#8230;and Caleb keeps trying to eat the galette on the cover. I guess we better make that recipe next!</p>

    <p style="text-align: left;">When I saw Todd and Diane&#8217;s recipe for a Roasted Broccoli Grilled Cheese in their new book, <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/twpeanthpo-20/detail/1617690481" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bountiful</a>, I knew I had to make them for my guys. Caleb asks for grilled cheese sandwiches on a regular basis&#8230;and so does Josh. I always try to make a salad or vegetable to go on the side, but I don&#8217;t have to with this grilled cheese. Putting veggies inside of the sandwich is genius!</p>

    <p style="text-align: left;">Roasted broccoli is so simple to make and brings out the best in broccoli. I could easily eat an entire pan by myself, but I refrained so I could make our sandwiches.</p>

    <p style="text-align: left;">You can&#8217;t go wrong with the broccoli and cheddar combination. It is a classic! Grilled buttered bread, melted cheese, and crisp roasted broccoli-now that&#8217;s a sandwich! My guys didn&#8217;t even complain about eating their veggies!</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">Next time you are in the mood for a grilled cheese sandwich, give this Roasted Broccoli Grilled Cheese a try! It&#8217;s great for lunch or dinner!</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">And to celebrate Todd and Diane&#8217;s beautiful new cookbook, <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/twpeanthpo-20/detail/1617690481" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bountiful</a>, we are giving away one copy to our readers!
