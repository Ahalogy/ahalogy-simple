      I am almost 17 weeks pregnant and my carb cravings are still going strong. The good news? I am finally eating and enjoying vegetables again. Of course, it helps if the veggies are served with carbsâ€¦like my new <a href="http://www.twopeasandtheirpod.com/penne-with-roasted-cauliflower-and-lemon-caper-vinaigrette/">favorite pasta dish</a>. I am making baby steps:)
    </p>

      <a href="http://www.twopeasandtheirpod.com/parmesan-crusted-pesto-grilled-cheese-sandwich/">Grilled cheese</a> <a href="http://www.twopeasandtheirpod.com/guacamole-grilled-cheese-sandwich/">sandwiches</a> have been my staple. I was going to make another grilled cheese for lunch, but I decided to branch out and make Roasted Mushroom and Gruyere Toasts instead. I know, itâ€™s basically an open-faced grilled cheese sandwich, but I added lots of mushrooms so it made me feel better. Who cares if the mushrooms were covered in melty cheese? They are still veggies!

      If you havenâ€™t tried mushrooms and thyme together, itâ€™s timeâ€¦ha! Thyme and mushrooms just go together. They are kindred spirits.

      I sliced Baby Bella mushrooms, tossed them with olive oil, fresh thyme, salt, and pepper.

      I roasted them in the oven until they were soft, juicy, and smelling good! Although, Caleb didnâ€™t think they smelled very good. He said, â€œMommy, what is that smell? It is stinky!â€ I guess he doesnâ€™t like the smell of mushrooms like his mama:)

      I sliced a loaf of crusty whole grain bread for my toasts. You can use your favorite bread, sourdough or French bread would work too! &nbsp;I put the bread under the broiler until the bread was nice and toasty!

    <p>
      I pulled the bread out of the oven and rubbed each slice with a clove of garlic. The garlic seeped into the warm bread! I topped the toasts with the roasted mushrooms and shredded Gruyere cheese.

    <p>
      I put the toasts back into the oven for a few minutesâ€¦just until the cheese melted over the roasted mushrooms. Look at all of that cheesy goodness!
    </p>
    <p>
      I didnâ€™t bother getting a plate. I ate my Roasted Mushroom and Gruyere Toasts right from the pan. So easy and SO good! I was only going to eat one, but I couldnâ€™t help myself. I had to go back for another one!
    </p>
    <p>
      And Caleb may not like the smell of mushrooms, but he sure enjoyed his Roasted Mushroom and Gruyere Toast. He kept telling me, â€œMommy, I ate it all gone!â€ He was proud of himselfâ€¦and I was proud of him too! I am so glad he forget about the stinky smell and ate lunch with me!
